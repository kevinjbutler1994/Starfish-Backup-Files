App: 'Where can I watch this?'

BLUF: App's purpose is to inform the user of where they can stream any movie or show. The app's api pulls from new releases, post-MVP the intention is for the streaming information to show for all movies.

When using the app, user types their movie of choice into the search bar, the app conducts an api call and returns data specific to that user's streaming service dashboard setup. 

MVP: 
Upon entering the search term, a column of movies and shows fitting the users description appears. As the user completes their query, the list narrows down to the user's specific choice.

Post MVP:

-Watchmode API has information for over 600,000 movies, however they only provide streaming info for the 100 newest releases. Post-MVP I will need to incorporate a new API that provides streaming info for a minimum of 300,000 movies. 

-International capability.

-For VPN users, if the movie is not available via their local streaming service, a popup with a link to an international version of their service could help the user still watch the film. -->
