## Intro

Let's get some practice working with control flow and logic in JavaScript! Think of it as doing reps or practicing scales! The more you practice, the better you'll get.

#### This lab is a DELIVERABLE

## Setup and Instructions

1. Fork and clone this repository.
3. In the [solutions.js](/solutions.js) file, complete the excercies and `console.log` each exercise's answer.
4. After completing each exercise, you may comment out that exercise's code to ease completion of subsequent exercises.
5. Before submitting, please uncomment ALL solutions.

## Exercises

```js
/*
 * Exercise 1:
 *
 * Create a loop that counts from 0 to 10, printing each number.
 */

/*
 * Exercise 2:
 *
 * Create a loop that prints every even number between 0 and 100.
 */

/*
 * Exercise 3:
 *
 * Create a loop that counts from -5 to 5, printing each number.
 */

/*
 * Exercise 4:
 *
 * Create a loop that counts down from 10 to 0, printing each number.
 */

/*
 * Exercise 5:
 *
 * Create a loop that counts down from 5 to -5, printing each number.
 */

/*
 * Exercise 6:
 *
 * Create a loop that counts from 0 to 50 in multiples of 2 (instead of 1),
 * printing each number.
 */

/*
 * Exercise 7:
 *
 * For the numbers 0 - 100, print out "I found a [ number ]. High five!" if the
 * number is a multiple of five.
 *
 * Sample Output:
 *   - I found a 5. High five!
 *   - I found a 10. High five!
 */

/*
 * Exercise 8:
 *
 * Create a variable called someNumber and assign it a random number between
 * 0 and 100.
 *
 * Create a conditional that matches these requirments:
 *   - if someNumber is less than 30, print "that's a small number"
 *   - if someNumber is between 30 and 60, print "the number is medium sized"
 *   - if someNumber is greater than 60, print "We got a big one!"
 */

/*
 * Exercise 9:
 *
 * Iterate over the starWars array printing each character's name and index
 *
 * i.e. 0. Han, 1. C3PO, 2. R2D2
 */

const StarWars = ['Han', 'C3PO', 'R2D2', 'Luke', 'Leia', 'Anakin'];

/*
 * Exercise 10:
 *
 * Write a loop that pushes every even number between 0 and 100 into an array,
 * then print the array.
 */

/*
 * Exercise 11:
 *
 * Find the median number in the following nums array (the mid point), then
 * console.log that number. In other words, given the array [ 10, 20, 30 ], 
 * your code would find and then console.log the 20.
 *
 * Hint: What does Math.floor() do?

];

/*
 * Exercise 12:
 *
 * Did you know that you can nest loops? The catch is that you have to use
 * different incrementers (normally i). You'll commonly see developers use
 * another 1-letter incrementer (j, k, l, etc).
 *
 * Create an "outer" loop that counts up from 1 to 10 with an incrementer of i.
 * Create an "inner" loop that counts from 11 to 20 with an incrementer of j.
 * Inside the inner loop, print `i: ${i} / j: ${j}` (Use backtics!)
 */

/*
 * Exercise 13:
 *
 * Using nested loops, print the values inside the nested arrays.
 */

let nestedArrays = [['a', 'b', 'c'], ['d', 'e', 'f'], ['g', 'h', 'i']];
